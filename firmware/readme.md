PP2U-E (2-port PCIe2.0-USB3.0 expansion board)

Product Summary:

PP2U is a 2-port USB 3.0 / SuperSpeed ​​USB compatible desktop PC expansion board.

By adding PP2U to a desktop PC, you can add a USB 3.0 port with a standard interface that can connect various peripheral devices from a keyboard to a high-speed data transfer hard disk. The USB port is hot pluggable and can easily connect USB peripherals.

USB3.0 is not only compatible with existing USB2.0, but also offers some enhancements.



High-speed transfer: bidirectional data transfer up to 5Gbps

Low power consumption: more advanced power management

Large capacity USB bus power: 5V / 900mA

Faster USB peripheral recognition.

More efficient data transmission processing

PP2U's PCI Express interface is compatible with PCIe 2.0 / Gen2, and can transmit data at up to 5 Gbps like USB3.0. It can also be used at 2.5Gbps in PCI Express Gen1 slots.

The USB3.0 interface maintains backward compatibility, and existing USB2.0 / 1.1 / 1.0 peripherals can be used.

By adding PP2U to a desktop PC, you can use not only USB 3.0 hard disks that support high-speed transfer, but also all USB peripheral devices such as existing USB memory, MP3 players, digital cameras, DVD / Blu-Ray drives, etc. can do.
